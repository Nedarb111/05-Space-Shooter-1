What I have here is a little space shooter game.
Story
1)The evil aliens have kidnapped your sister.
2)You must fight them to get her back.



Directions
1)Use your mouse to move around and left click to shoot
2)There are two levels to this game. The enemies on the level 2 will be a lot harder to destroy.
(Good Luck out there.)










On this assignment, I able to add two levels
1)The first contains five tiny ships (each one has 100 health)
2)The second contains four mini bosses and one boss (the mini bosses are a little harder to kill than the tiny ships, and the boss is the hardest to kill.)
    2a)The mini boss gives you 1100 points and the boss gives you 1600 points.
3)I added missiles as the "bullets"
4)There is a score keeper in the top left corner of the screen.
5)All of the enemies are able to move to a certain extent.
6)I could not figure out how to make the enemies shoot back.
7)I was able to get my background image to display, but it displayed in front of the game. I decided to just take it out of the game.
8)I also tried to add music to go along with the game, but that attempt failed as well.
